Example 6: Get and load Experiments to R-Series

This example is a python script of automated saving and loading files through
OPC communication. This performs the following tasks: 
- Read the current experiment loaded on the R-Series device connected on
    a given address and port.
- Save the readed experiment on a given path.
- Load an experiment stored on a given path.
