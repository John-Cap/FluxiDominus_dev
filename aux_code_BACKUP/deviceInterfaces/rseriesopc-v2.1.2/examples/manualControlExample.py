Example 1: Manual Control

This example is a python script of an automated reaction but using manual 
control. This performs the following tasks: 
- Running a reactor and ramping flow rate from rampInitFlowrate value to 
    rampStopFlowrate over a time given by rampTime.
- Constant temperature at tempSetpoint. This includes pre-heating flow rate 
    and time period
- Polling for target temperature and final clean/cooling as manual steps.

For running this script all the modules has to be set as R2 types

    This function take a pump and sets its flowrate.
    While the clock clk runs, and this function is called, the flow rate of the
    pump will be growing as a ramp to reach the maximum amplitud in a desired
    period of time.
    Then the flow rate will be set to 0 and start to growing up again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pump : rseriesopc.PumpType
        This is the pump that its flow rate will be set.
    fromValue : intenger
        This is the offset flow rate for the ramp.
    toValue : integer
        This is the final flow rate for the ramp. This value will be get at
        the end of the period
    period : integer
        This is the time in seconds between the flow rate goes fromValue to
        get toValue.
    clk : integer
        This is the running clock. Its units are in seconds.

    Returns
    -------
    None.
