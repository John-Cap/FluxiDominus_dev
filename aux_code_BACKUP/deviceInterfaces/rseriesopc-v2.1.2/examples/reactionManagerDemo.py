@brief This is a demonstration about the Reaction Manager methods walk-through.

@details Before run this script, the RSeries Controller has to be running and 
at least one reaction needs to be added to the Reaction List. 
(Experiment -> Edit Reactions). Also, the name of the reaction to demo
must be given on reactionName parameter

In addition, the OPC Server feature has to be present in the R-Series 
Controller.
