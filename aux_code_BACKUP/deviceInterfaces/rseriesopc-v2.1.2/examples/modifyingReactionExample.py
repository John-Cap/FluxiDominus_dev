Example 4b: Modifying Reaction

This example replace a reaction in a reaction list by other with new 
parameters.
In order to replace the reaction, the new reaction must be created, loaded into
the ReactionList. Then the old one has to be removed and the new one must to
be set in the desired place.

For running the example, the experiment example4 must to be loaded in R-Series 
Controller and the OPC server must be enabled. The example will change the
reaction list so making a backup of the example folder is recommended.
