Example 4a: Adding a Reaction

This example reads a data set, modifies one parameter of a reaction and 
add the resultant reaction to the reaction list.

In order to make a new reaction, a reaction is copied of the ReactionList.
Then the reaction is modified and append to the ReactionList.

For running this example the expmeriment "example4" must to be loaded to the
R-Series Controller.
This script modifies the Reaction List so making a backup of the example4
folder is recommended.
